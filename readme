1. In app.py, a flask web server is being created. Host and port is also defined in the last line of the code.


2. A base environment python3.8 is selected in the Dockerfile.
   Then the working directory is selected and the content of the current directory in which we are in is     
   copied into the working directory.
   
   In app.py we require flask. So in the Dockerfile, I include "RUN pip install flask"command.
   
   "CMD ["python", "app.py"]" - This CMD command tells what to run when container starts. In this case, app.py
   is to be executed with python.
   
   
 3. "docker build -t flask_docker_app ." -  Run this command to create docker image.
 
 
 4. "docker run -p 5000:5000 flask_docker_app" - Run the application using this command.
